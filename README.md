# 100 JavaScript Projects Challenge

This is a challenge that I have set myself to push 100 JavaScript Projects into this repository. 
'JavaScript' here refers to the primary language that I'll be using and so the projects can include but are not limited to the following: 
websites that include JavaScript, web applications that use node.js and express, simple JavaScript games, JavaScript and jQuery projects
API based projects, bots, react.js, node-sql projects etc.

This is solely for learning purposes and to track improvement.


### Challenge 1 
from https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-conditional-statements-and-loops-exercises.php (number 5)

Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

Sample Output: 
"0 is even" 
"1 is odd" 
"2 is even" 

### Challenge 2
from Angela Yu's The complete web development bootcamp from Udemy.
Using the .length, .slice and .toUpperCase functions and string concatenation create a programme that automatically converts user input so that it always starts with a capital letter and rest are lower case letters. 

### Challenge 3
from Angela Yu's The complete web development bootcamp from Udemy.
Create a mini programme that slices the user's input to only give you the first 140 characters (I changed it to 280). Tell the user how many characters they have used up and what's left and outputs the sliced tweet.
