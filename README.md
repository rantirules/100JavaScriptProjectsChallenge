# 100JavaScriptProjectsChallenge

This is a challenge that I have set myself to push 100 JavaScript Projects into this repository. 
'JavaScript' here refers to the primary language that I'll be using and so the projects can include but are not limited to the following: 
websites that include JavaScript, web applications that use node.js and express, simple JavaScript games, JavaScript and jQuery projects
API based projects, bots, react.js, node-sql projects etc.

This is solely for learning purposes and to track improvement.


#Challenge 1 from https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-conditional-statements-and-loops-exercises.php (number 5)
Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

Sample Output: 
"0 is even" 
"1 is odd" 
"2 is even"
